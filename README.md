## INTRODUCTION

We get to look at at dataset of football players, their traits and what makes them be who they are in this world.

We'll get to see who the best footballers are, the fastest, the strongest among others. One question you can ask yourself is, 'Does age really matter when it comes to performance ?'
With the help of python tools among the others that we shall be using, we'll get to answer some of the burning questions.

We shall be looking at players, goalkeepers for example, according to their age, nationality, gk reflexes, diving, positioning and speed and not forgetting their kicking power.

With that, we can now get to see what we desire to see.
